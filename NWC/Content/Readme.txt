This pack contains:

7 tree meshes with collision, LODs and billboards.

9 debris/dead tree meshes with collision, and LODs (This includes 2 stumps made using Photogrammetry).

11 plant/fern meshes with LODs.

These assets can be used in tandem to create optimized Cedar forest game environments with a focus on beauty and realism.


	
Features: 

Unified Wind: A material parameter collection is included which allows for adjustments to the wind sway amount and intensity across all the assets included in the pack. https://youtu.be/5EwDp7GJSQ4.

Customization: The pack makes use of several instances with many exposed parameters to make sure you can always tweak the look of the assets to your scene.

Intelligent Randomization: All trees contain a dis-coloration near the base of the tree, and some tree meshes contain a moss layer also. These are both randomized in a realistic and reasonable manner per instance. This ensures that 2 instances of the same mesh will not contain identical bases. The randomization extents can also be set in the material instance.
 Focus on performance: Every asset is designed with overdraw performance in mind while still maintaining reasonable polygon count.


Texture Sizes:

Most atlases are kept at 2,048 by 2,048.
